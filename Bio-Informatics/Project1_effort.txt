- [ ] Does the position of nucleotide present in genome should be same always with the position of nucleotide in read.. Ex: AGTCATC is a substring in genome[25:31] then can this string be at read[10:16] or should it be read[25:31] ANSWER: position doesn't matter
- [ ] What if the position of a nucleotide is at the last of the genome

- [ ] What is “ all nucleotide should be present in read” means 
    - [ ] Can a sub string does not have one or two nucleotides from “AGTC”. ex: AGGTTAA if this is one of the sub string in genome generated with position genome[7:13] and is present in read[25:31]. Does this hold valid? 
    - [x] Should AGTC along the sub string position be present in the reads.

such that every nucleotide in the genome from 1 is in a minimum of 4 reads



also   - What is “ all nucleotide should be present in read” means  - Can a sub string does not have one or two nucleotides from original nucleotide which is “AGTC”.   ex:  genome ATGAAGGTTAAGGTTAAC.  AGGTTAA if this is one of the sub string in genome with position genome[7:13] and is present in read[25:31]. Does this hold valid even though read does not have nucleotide “C”?   PS: array representation array[starting_index : ending_index]
